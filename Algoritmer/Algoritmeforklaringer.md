#### Linear Programming
* Plays a central role in design and analysis of approximation algorithms
* Important Terms
    * **Decision variables**: represent some sort of decisions that need to be made
    * **Constraints**: Variables are constrained by a number of linear inequalities  
    * **Feasible solutions**: Any assignment of real numbers to the variables such that the constraints are satisfied
* Exists efficient algorithms to solve LP 
* Example
